# Portfolio-site
Portfolio site built in React (NextJs).
The non deployed website is configured to run on port 3000 using localhost.(localhost:3000).
The website should work as soon as you have the server up and running.
All buttons except for Learn More should redirect the user to a specific location on the page. For example, the 'Projects' tab will navigate to the Projects portion of the site. 
All links are to my actual social media accounts, email address as well as cell-phone number. 

the link to the deployed version is the following: https://membaportfolio.netlify.app
